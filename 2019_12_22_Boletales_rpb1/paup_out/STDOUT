Bootstrap method with heuristic search:
  Number of bootstrap replicates = 1000
  Starting seed = generated automatically
  Number of characters resampled in each replicate = 1382
  Optimality criterion = parsimony
    Character-status summary:
      Of 1382 total characters:
        All characters are of type 'unord'
        All characters have equal weight
        374 characters are constant (proportion = 0.270622)
        232 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative
        Number of parsimony-informative characters = 776
    Gaps are treated as "missing"
    Multistate taxa interpreted as uncertainty
  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
    Addition sequence: random
    Number of replicates = 10
    Starting seed = generated automatically
    Number of trees held at each step = 1
  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8
    Steepest descent option not in effect
  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100 (will be auto-increased by 100)
  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
  'MulTrees' option in effect
  No topological constraints in effect
  Trees are unrooted
